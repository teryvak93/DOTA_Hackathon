# DOTA_Hackathon

This code was written for an Analytics Vidhya hackathon. 
The dataset consists of professional Dota players and their most frequent hero characters (10 of them). 
We have each character details like hero type (nuker, initiator, etc), base attack, strength, movement speed.

Here both train and test dataset is divided into two files(train9.csv & train1.csv and test9.csv & test1.csv).

The objective is to predict the performance of the 10th character, given performance with 9 other heroes.

The first version of the notebook contains feature exploration, correlation etc
